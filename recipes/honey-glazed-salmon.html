  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Salmon</li>
      <ul>
        <li>4 (6oz each)salmon filets</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp blacking seasoning <em>(optional)</em></li>
      </ul>
    <li>Sauce</li>
      <ul>
        <li>2 Tbsp butter</li>
        <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>6 clove garlic <em>minced</em>
        <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp water</li>  
        <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp sriracha sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp lemon juice</li>
      </ul>
  </ol>
  <h1>Steps</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Pat salmon dry, then season with salt, pepper, paprika and blackening seasoning (if using). Set aside.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Important</strong></em> Adjust oven rack to middle position, then preheat broiler. If you broil this with the rack up high the sauce will burn.
    <li>Add butter and oil to a large, oven-safe skillet over MED-HIGH heat. Once butter is melted, add garlic, water, soy sauce, sriracha, honey and lemon juice and cook 30 seconds or so, until sauce is heated through.</li>
    <li>Add salmon, skin side down (if using salmon with skin), and cook 3 minutes. While salmon cooks, baste frequently with sauce from the pan by spooning it over the top of the salmon.</li>
    <li>Broil salmon for 5-6 minutes, basting with sauce once during the broil, until salmon is caramelized and cooked to desired doneness.</li>
    <li>Garnish with minced parsley if desired.</li>
  </ol>
